<h3>Things examined</h3>

<p>lock_time the time the server will wait</p>

<p>rows examined</p>

<p>tmp_tables - creating these temp tables are bad</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product">cartisan product</a></p>

<p>indexes- once you created them run completed under the hood
can only use one index per table</p>

<p>Review: <a href="http://www.simple-talk.com/sql/performance/execution-plan-basics/">Query execution plan</a>
<a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/9990/SQL-Tuning-Tutorial-Understanding-a-Database-Execu">more reading</a></p>

<ul>
<li>only way to get around this is to change the structre&#8211; i.e. denormalization</li>
</ul>


<h3>Indexes</h3>

<ul>
<li>cost per write -> re-indexing</li>
<li>Can use indexes to set constraints on your data</li>
</ul>


<p>Cardinality
: how chunky your data is</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>SELECT COUNT(*) title FROM tags t INNER JOIN tags_entity_links tel ON t.id = tel.tag_id WHERE category = 1 AND title</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The tags are polymorphic:
tag table
id | tag_id | id_for_table | type</p>

<p>performance to denormalization
??performance or aggregate data</p>

<p>composite index</p>

<p>LEFT JOIN or RIGHT JOIN will show the nulls that wouldn&#8217;t be included in INNER JOIN</p>

<p>The NoSQL camp is a return to hierarchical data stores - a 40 year old</p>

<p>count or cache</p>

<p>three seperate databases = 3 apps</p>

<p>Testing:</p>

<pre><code>apache bench
watch the slow logs
cacti tool
load on the server
</code></pre>

<h3>Questions</h3>

<p>?? why mysql over postgres?</p>

<ul>
<li>right place right time</li>
</ul>


<p>MySQL:</p>

<ul>
<li>percona port makes the most sense for mysql-</li>
</ul>


<p>?? many proj has many tags - many to many - goes through what join table?</p>

<p>Look up:</p>

<ul>
<li>jumping words in the terminal</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Like any n00b, I spent a lot of time learning the skills of programming online. Outside of random YouTube Videos (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/thenewboston">NewBoston</a> is worth your time), there are three well-known online products&#8211; <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/">Code School</a>, <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/">Treehouse</a>, and <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>. I&#8217;d estimate, I&#8217;ve spent around 80 hours on these sites. I don&#8217;t know if that is a lot or a little, but I do know that Code School is the clear winner&#8230;</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/codeschool.jpeg" title="Code School" ></p>

<h3>Codecademy</h3>

<p>(not to be confused with <a href="http://www.builtinchicago.org/blog/code-academy-evolves-starter-league-and-partners-37signals">Code Academy</a>) <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/codecademy-1000000-users-2012-1">exploded on the scene last fall</a>, but really falls short in the <a href="http://programmingzen.com/2012/01/16/on-the-usability-of-codecademy/">usability</a> department and error feedback. To be fair, I only have spent time with their JavaScript courses, but it&#8217;s hard to get past first impressions. Granted, Codecademy is run by a <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/07/25/zach-sims-codecademy/">couple of young&#8217;ins</a> and haven&#8217;t had the head start that Code School has on its interactive browser, but I found myself more than frustrated going through their lessons. If they spent less time, hammering my inbox with weekly emails and built a better interface, I&#8217;d be more likely to take a look at their newly updated and <a href="(http://www.crunchbase.com/company/codecademy">well funded site</a> (I&#8217;ve heard they added Ruby lessons). At least for now, Codecademy is FREE. So serious brownie points there.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I recently revisited <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> and the usability (which is clearly my biggest gripe above) has really been refined and improved. In fact, I was impressed with the ease of use this go around&#8230; If I were starting from scratch I would start here, while Code School caters to an intermediate skill level and above.)</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/codecademy.png" width="450" height="300" title="Codecademy Inbox" ></p>

<h3>Treehouse is&#8230;</h3>

<p>in a word, boring. Thankfully, I was able to guess most of the answers without struggling through the videos. I did spend, however, a portion of the time learning about subjects on the periphery. Their explanations of structs, I/O, and Ruby Core had slipped through the cracks of other beginner Ruby tutorials. I couldn&#8217;t get into the humor of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQNXtyoyHic">Mike the Frog</a> or some of their other movie &#8220;rewards,&#8221; but I guess that really shouldn&#8217;t be the main motivating factor. While others thought it is silly, I like that <a href="https://twitter.com/jseifer">Jason Seifer</a> is such a goofball. He is the lone source of humor in an overall dry learning experience. Personally, I learn faster by doing and Treehouse falls short here. Though they do sprinkle in a few interactive quizzes, it just isn&#8217;t enough. If you are going to financially invent in your learning, I&#8217;d save it for&#8230;</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/small_Codecademy-Treehouse-Blog-Logo.png" title="Codecademy and Treehouse" ></p>

<h3>Code School</h3>

<p><strong>rocks</strong>. It has clearly been the best use of my time. The videos are much more in-depth and the interactive browser is the superior to everything else I&#8217;ve seen. The <a href="http://envylabs.com/">Envy Labs Team</a> goes into significantly more detail than their aforementioned competitors. Their material is engaging, challenging, and well thought-out. What I enjoyed most (besides the information of course) is the self-depreciating humor that dots their casts. Cheesy graphics and dedication to a theme, for example Zombie terminology, finds the right balance of hilarious and non-interfering entertainment. When I first took their beginner courses, I grumbled at the level of detail they covered. Now that I picked up a few things, Code School does an amazing job of covering the entire breadth of subjects within a topic. Maybe most importantly, the error feedback is actually useful as are their hints. My sole criticism is that there is a recognizable difference between <a href="https://twitter.com/greggpollack">Gregg Pollack</a> and the others characters. If he could navigate the office politics, Gregg should do all the casts.</p>

<p>Now in my 7th month of my programming career, <a href="http://shitavisays.tumblr.com/">Avi&#8217;s words</a> have more meaning than ever:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not about learning the syntax. Anyone can learn that. Learning to program is learning how to communicate.&#8221; &#8211; Avi Flombaum</p></blockquote>

<p>If you are going to learn the syntax (which we DO need to do), Code School is very much worth it and <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/code-school-learn-by-doing">I&#8217;m not the only one who thinks so</a>. But what do I know? Not that much. What do you think?</p>

<p>(Tip to <a href="https://twitter.com/davidbakertv">David Baker</a> for the subject.)</p>

<h3>Homework Review</h3>

<p>table names should be plaural (e.g.table USERS)</p>

<p>id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY -> always be called ID, is an integer and auto increments</p>

<p>&#8216;never use ruby for something SQL can do&#8217;</p>

<p>you want to group by integer values rather than string values</p>

<p>AS aliases the columns</p>

<p>subqueries- as long as a query returns one and only one value you can use that for another query</p>

<p><a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/10/a-visual-explanation-of-sql-joins.html">Visual explanation of sql</a></p>

<h3>INDEXes</h3>

<ul>
<li>index a column when it is being used in columns or queries</li>
<li>should index foreign keys (they are not automatically indexed)</li>
<li>cost: everytime you add a record it has to reindex</li>
<li>indexes compromise the write speed in favor of read speed</li>
</ul>


<p>Two optimization steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>denormalize (add more columns)</li>
<li><p>index - optimize for write or read?</p>

<ul>
<li>the more indexes your keys are using the more efficient your DB will be</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>You optimize the joins by denormalizing (and thus removing the need for joins) and indexing</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Index structures: if you create an index on the primary key and then search for a row of data based on one of the primary key values, SQL Server first finds that value in the index, and then uses the index to quickly locate the entire row of data. Without the index, a table scan would have to be performed in order to locate the row, which can have a significant effect on performance. <a href="http://www.simple-talk.com/sql/learn-sql-server/sql-server-index-basics/">source</a></p>

<p>Many databases have one special index per table where all of the data from a row exists in the index. SQL Server calls this index a <em>clustered index</em>. Instead of an index at the back of a book, a clustered index is closer in similarity to a phone book because each index entry contains all the information you need, there are no references to follow to pick up additional data values.<a href="http://odetocode.com/code/237.aspx">Source</a></p>

<p>The <em>EXPLAIN</em> statement can be used either as a way to obtain information about how MySQL executes a statement, or as a synonym for DESCRIBE. <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/explain.html">source</a> In other words, a SQL statement can be preceded by the keyword &#8220;EXPLAIN&#8221; or by the phrase &#8220;EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN&#8221;. Either modification causes the SQL statement to behave as a query and to return information about how the SQL statement would have operated if the EXPLAIN keyword or phrase had been omitted. <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/lang_explain.html">source</a></p>

<h3>Normalized DB</h3>

<ul>
<li>A normalized database is one where you minimize duplication of data by keeping groups of data in separate tables and linking (using indexes) between the tables.</li>
<li>Another def: Database normalization is the process of organizing the fields and tables of a relational database to minimize redundancy and dependency. Normalization usually involves dividing large tables into smaller (and less redundant) tables and defining relationships between them. The objective is to isolate data so that additions, deletions, and modifications of a field can be made in just one table and then propagated through the rest of the database via the defined relationships.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Optimization</h3>

<ul>
<li>Write operations are always more expensive than reads.</li>
<li>Use memCache</li>
<li>use background tasks to do your database activity offline</li>
<li>Denormalize: database normalization is a fatal mistake.

<ul>
<li>A de-noramlized database is one where you keeps redundant frequently-accessed data, duplicated across several tables, making it possible to fulfill a user request without having to look at more than a single table.</li>
<li>The key to high performance database access is sticking to single-table SELECT queries with short indexes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MySQL Triggers (starting from MySQL 5.0) allow us to define a rule to perform whenever a certain table is updated.
<a href="http://www.softwareprojects.com/resources/programming/t-database-performance-optimization-denormalization-1410.html">source</a></li>
</ul>


<p>The SQL HAVING clause is &#8220;like a WHERE clause for aggregated data.&#8221; It&#8217;s used with conditional statements, just like WHERE, to filter results. One thing to note is that any column name appearing in the HAVING clause must also appear in the GROUP BY clause.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Git Talk with Julia West</p>

<p>git pull = git fetch + git merge
git pull &#8211;rebase = git fetch + git rebase #generally don&#8217;t get the merge commit</p>

<p>git rebase -i &#8220;HEAD~5&#8221; #=> shows 5 most recent commits in the branch</p>

<p>squash commits- helps you combine commits</p>

<p>merging with fastforwarding
no fast forward is the default at github.</p>

<p>master- ready to go into production
all the work we do is on the feature branch</p>

<p>An important part of the anatomy of a commit is who is its parent</p>

<p>&#8220;I keep merging master into my feature branch so that I can have all the commit histories.&#8221; A rebase will lose the commit histories.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Remotes</h3>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>git remote -v, which shows you the URL that Git has stored for the shortname to be expanded to:
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>$ git remote -v
</span><span class='line'>origin  git://github.com/schacon/ticgit.git
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>$ git remote add [shortname] [url]
</span><span class='line'>$ git remote rm [shortname]

<h3>Fetch</h3>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ git fetch [remote-name]</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ul>
<li>It’s important to note that the <strong>fetch</strong> command pulls the data to your local repository — it doesn’t automatically merge it with any of your work or modify what you’re currently working on. You have to merge it manually into your work when you’re ready.</li>
<li>The <em>git pull</em> command to automatically fetch and then merge a remote branch into your current branch.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Pushes</h3>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>git push [remote-name] [branch-name]</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Branches</h3>

<p>You can delete a remote branch using the rather obtuse syntax &#8216;$ git push [remotename] :[branch]&#8217;. If you want to delete your serverfix branch from the server, you run the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ git push origin &lt;:branch name&gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ git branch -d &lt;branch name&gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Rebasing</h3>

<p>In Git, there are two main ways to integrate changes from one branch into another: the <em>merge</em> and the <em>rebase.</em></p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ git rebase master</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It works by going to the common ancestor of the two branches (the one you’re on and the one you’re rebasing onto), getting the diff introduced by each commit of the branch you’re on, saving those diffs to temporary files, resetting the current branch to the same commit as the branch you are rebasing onto, and finally applying each change in turn.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong>
Do not rebase commits that you have pushed to a public repository.</p>

<h3>Branching</h3>

<p>This will create a new branch based on an revision: <code>♕ git co -b new-branch-name old-branch-name</code></p>

<h3>Questions</h3>

<p>What is a reasonable number of commits per branch?
How often do you commit?
Working on the same file&#8230; strategies?
fast forward vs no fast forward</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Learning inject has been on my TODO list for a while&#8230;</p>
