<h3>Object Orientation</h3>

<p>once you have a user class, you can send it a message
once you have a class you can teach the class how to do things like authenticate a user</p>

<h3>Review</h3>

<p>iteration: going through many things one at a time
we refer to that character one at a time, as the iterator or yield</p>

<p>.inspect allows you to look at an object that</p>

<p>common to have nested iteration-- iterate through them, by looping through enumerables within a loop</p>

<p>Iterating a hash you get yielded two variables at once, the key first and the value second</p>

<p>``` ruby
alphabet = {:a => 1, :b => 2}</p>

<p>alphabet.each do |key, value|
  puts "#{key} is the #{value} letter"
end
```</p>

<p>.compact will get rid of any nil values
.uniq will get rid of duplicates</p>

<p>! methods will change the data set forever...</p>

<p>.flatten will remove nesting from an array-- will flatten all elements in array
.reverse elements in the array</p>

<p>side note: python believes there is one way to do something. Ruby believes there should be many ways to do it so that you can be more expressive.</p>

<p><code>ruby ordinalize is a integer method
1.ordinalize     # =&gt; "1st"
2.ordinalize     # =&gt; "2nd"
1002.ordinalize  # =&gt; "1002nd"
</code></p>

<p>``` ruby multiple_of?(number)</p>

<h1>Check whether the integer is evenly divisible by the argument.</h1>

<p>0.multiple_of?(0)  #=> true
6.multiple_of?(5)  #=> false
10.multiple_of?(2) #=> true
```</p>

<p>Lab solution (8PM)</p>

<p>hash structure with root or without root TODO</p>

<p>.detect, .select and .reject methods are all useful array elements</p>

<p>class CONSTANTS are really good for storing data about the class</p>

<h3>Array Review:</h3>

<p><code>ruby
empty[0] = "filled" #=&gt; can assign slots one at a time
easy_as[1, 5] #=&gt; can slice elements off, have elastic arrays --&gt; can add elements to an array without doing anything else
</code></p>

<h3>Lecture:</h3>

<p>Object orientation- we send object methods
important to identify who the receiver is and what the method is
part of dot notation: every method returns an object, so you can chain another method on it
it's the return of the previous method that is the receiver for the following method</p>

<p>the strip method is part of the family of normalization</p>

<p>gsub = global substitution
sub will only replace the first occurrence it encounters</p>

<p>== is the same as eql method</p>

<p>methods that end with question marks --> the ? is part of the method name that indicates it returns a boolean value</p>

<p>strings like arrays can be sliced</p>

<p>match accepts a pattern of REGEX
  -the string literal for patterns are /a/e/i/o/u
  -check <a href="http://rubluar.com">http://rubluar.com</a></p>

<p><strong>Iteration</strong> is a fancy word for looping</p>

<p>anything that can iterated upon is described as an <em>enumerable</em>
strings and arrays are enumerables</p>

<p><strong>Scope</strong></p>

<p>scope gates -- every time you see a 'do', 'end', 'def' keyword your scope changed.</p>

<p>blocks have an exclusive scope. If it is defined in that block and only in that block it is accessible for the outside.
method scopes are even stricter. cannot access method outside of that particular method.
parameters are how you pass in values into a method.</p>

<p>2nd program- (8:25- 8:35)
artist, album, song sorting</p>

<p><em>first step in a program is usually to set up state</em></p>

<p><strong>More Data Types</strong>
<em>Hashes</em> a lot like an array in that it is a collection object. An array is only indexed, so you can only refer to the objects within the array by its position</p>

<p><em>Literal Constructors:</em></p>

<p>"" - strings</p>

<p>/ - REGEX</p>

<p>[] - array</p>

<p>{} - hashes</p>

<p>: - symbols</p>

<p>Hashes are valuable when you care about the meta data</p>

<p>every time you create a new string, it creates a new object in memory
a symbol is an immutable object
``` ruby
vending machine {</p>

<pre><code>a: =&gt; ["snickers", "twix", "kit kat"]
</code></pre>

<p>}
puts vending_machine[:a][0] #=> this accesses the :a key and the 0th position of the array which is the value
```</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://rubysource.com/build-your-own-social-network-with-diaspora-an-introduction/">What is diaspora?</a></p>

<p>Now I need to decide what DB I'm going to use. I poked around and found <a href="http://mariadb.org/">MariaDB</a>, but Avi suggested I go with <a href="http://www.percona.com/">Percona</a>, MySQL or Postgres. Postgres seems to have the best intergration with Heroku so I'll go with that...</p>

<p>I already have psql version 9.0.5. This isn't the newest version... TODO</p>

<p><strong><em>Open SSL</em></strong>
The <a href="http://www.openssl.org/about/"><strong>OpenSSL</strong></a> Project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured, and Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols as well as a full-strength general purpose cryptography library managed by a worldwide community of volunteers that use the Internet to communicate, plan, and develop the OpenSSL toolkit and its related documentation.
- I'm not really sure what all that means... so I checked out
Here is what I found:
 - TLS and its predecessor SSL make significant use of certificate authorities.
 - The browser then uses the public key to encrypt a randomly selected symmetric key. Public-key encryption takes a lot of computing, so most systems use a combination of public-key and symmetric key encryption. When two computers initiate a secure session, one computer creates a symmetric key and sends it to the other computer using public-key encryption. The two computers can then communicate using symmetric-key encryption. Once the session is finished, each computer discards the symmetric key used for that session. Any additional sessions require that a new symmetric key be created, and the process is repeated.
 I can circle back to learn more <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/software/how-ssl-and-tls-works-1047412">here.</a> TODO</p>

<p>I also have openSSL installed, but I'll update through
<code>
brew install openssl
</code>
This downloaded the package, but didn't update the version that I currently have. It stil shows:
<code>
♕ openssl version
OpenSSL 0.9.8r 8 Feb 2011
</code>
That's not great. Well I can't fix it now... another TODO</p>

<p><strong><em>cURL</em></strong> groks URLs <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">http://curl.haxx.se/</a>
curl is a command line tool for transferring data with URL syntax, supporting DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, Gopher, HTTP, HTTPS, IMAP, IMAPS, LDAP, LDAPS, POP3, POP3S, RTMP, RTSP, SCP, SFTP, SMTP, SMTPS, Telnet and TFTP. curl supports SSL certificates, HTTP POST, HTTP PUT, FTP uploading, HTTP form based upload, proxies, cookies, user+password authentication (Basic, Digest, NTLM, Negotiate, kerberos...), file transfer resume, proxy tunneling and a busload of other useful tricks.
- To <strong>grok</strong> is to intimately and completely share the same reality or line of thinking with another physical or conceptual entity.
- There is a tutorial <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/libcurl-tutorial.html">http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/libcurl-tutorial.html</a>. this however mostly focuses on C so I'm not even close to understanding it.
- There is another intro <a href="http://blog.instabill.com/index.php/2011/12/21/a-brief-introduction-to-curl">here</a> that appears to be more my speed.
- also there is a <a href="">video</a>
 - don't know what any of this means... but I do have it installed. Another TODO</p>

<p><strong><em>imagemagick</em></strong> is next:
<code>
brew install imagemagick
</code>
That was easy...</p>

<p><strong><em>Redis</em></strong>
need redis as well.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redis">Redis, known as a key value store or document store,</a> is pretty much just a hash.
"In its outer layer, the Redis data model is a dictionary where keys are mapped to values."
That sounds like a hash to me.
Anyways...
<code>
brew install redis
</code>
There is a <a href="http://try.redis-db.com/">try redis</a> tutorial.

♕ rvm install ruby-1.9.3-p125
Already installed ruby-1.9.3-p125.
To reinstall use:</p>

<pre><code>rvm reinstall ruby-1.9.3-p125
</code></pre>

<p>```
Not good. I looked at the install log but it didn't provide much help. So after a google search I found <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/issues/311">this</a>, which suggests it is the .gemrc file. So now I'm in over my head...</p>

<p>So Avi to the rescue. I reinstalled patch 125 with:
<code>
rvm reinstall ruby-1.9.3-p125
</code>
That sucks I was so hung up on this.</p>

<p>So I bundled again after removing the mysql gem from the gem file since I'm using postgreSQL.</p>

<p>It bundled properly but I can't get thin to boot...</p>

<p>P.S.
??Should I include a sym link?</p>

<p>Setting Up Octopress</p>

<p><a href="http://octopress.org/docs/setup/">http://octopress.org/docs/setup/</a></p>

<p>Had one hiccup in my system didn't have Ruby 1.9.2 which .rvmrc file requires (https://rvm.io//workflow/rvmrc/). I had to go ahead and install it.</p>

<p>Deploying on Heroku:</p>

<p>To see on localhost:4000
rake preview</p>

<p><strong>To push:</strong>
<code>
rake generate
git add .
git commit -m 'site updated'
git push heroku master
</code></p>

<p><a href="http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/heroku/">Octopress delpoy instructons</a></p>

<p>That all went fairly well... though I didn't understand all the intermediate steps. I'll have to take closer look.</p>
