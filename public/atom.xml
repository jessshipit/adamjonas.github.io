<ul>
<li>I copied over app with a foundation built in. Can&#8217;t of course copy over the secret token. <code>rake secret</code> will generate the new token <a href="http://www.jamesbadger.ca/2012/12/18/generate-new-secret-token/">via</a>.</li>

<h3>Geolocation</h3>

<li>the method <a href="http://diveintohtml5.info/geolocation.html">found here</a>, which should be the canonical source didn&#8217;t work for me.</li>

<h3>Print styling</h3>

<ul>
<li>needed to remove the deafult media=&#8217;screen&#8217; in order to load these styles via <a href="http://lawrencenaman.com/optimisation/print-media-queries-not-working/">this post</a></li>
<li>in application.rb needed to include <code>config.assets.precompile += ['print_wishlist.css']</code> so that it is precompiled separately. Though it was written in sass it needed the print_wishlist.css.sass extensions as sass isn&#8217;t recognized in the app.rb as it expect the file after compilation rather than before <a href="http://jalada.co.uk/2012/01/23/adding-files-to-config-assets-precompile-in-rails-3-1.html">via</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h3>local storage versus cookies</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>client versus server</strong> -> Cookies and local storage really serve difference purposes. Cookies are primarily for reading server-side, local storage can only be read client-side. So the question is, in your app, who needs this data — the client or the server? If it&#8217;s your client (your JavaScript), then by all means switch. You&#8217;re wasting bandwidth by sending all the data in each HTTP header. If it&#8217;s your server, local storage isn&#8217;t so useful because you&#8217;d have to forward the data along somehow (with Ajax or hidden form fields or something). This might be okay if the server only needs a small subset of the total data for each request.</li>
<li><strong>Size</strong> -> Apart from being an old way of saving data, Cookies give you a limit of 4096 bytes (4095, actually) - its per cookie. Local Storage is as big as 5MB per domain.</li>
<li>Cute -> you can test your local storage <a href="http://arty.name/localstorage.html">here</a>.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Turbolinks replaces the body of the page but doesn&#8217;t reload the header files. This limits the number of calls and makes the site appear faster to the user by a noticeable margin.</p>

<h3>To remove turbolinks for Rails 4</h3>

<ul>
<li>(3 steps from Steve Klabnik)[http://blog.steveklabnik.com/posts/2013-06-25-removing-turbolinks-from-rails-4]</li>
</ul>


<h3>Breaking my JS</h3>

<ul>
<li>Turbolink breaks my JS calls when the page loads up the Facebook SDK. So I started disabling turbolinks on certain pages in my HAML a tag with the &#8220;data-no-turbolink&#8221; option <code>= link_to 'add friends', next_wizard_path, "data-no-turbolink" =&gt; "true"</code></li>
<li>There are also events that one can hook into. They are (listed here)[https://github.com/rails/turbolinks/#events].</li>
<li>You can also put the click event on the doc rather than the element which will solve this issue. In this case ajax tasks would also have the click event applied to them as well.</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Click Event on doc rather than element</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="err">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">this</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">parent</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;form&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">submit</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>The jquery turbolinks gem</h3>

<ul>
<li>Using (the gem)[https://github.com/kossnocorp/jquery.turbolinks] just straight fixes it. This likely means that the turbolinks is disabled for all jquery related calls.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Reading</h3>

<ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Asset Trouble</h3>

<ul>
<li>Rails 3.1.3 legacy app The images were coming through, but the JS and css wasn&#8217;t compiling.</li>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15811889/my-rails-javascript-manifest-file-doesnt-compile-nor-include-any-required-files">This</a> inspired us to roll back to 1.9.3, which worked.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Coffeescript hashes</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>this one took me a hot second -> <code>delete obj[key]</code></p>

<ul>
<li>courtesy of <a href="http://coffeescript.org/documentation/docs/helpers.html">the docs</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>counting the keys in an object was pretty close to javascript <code>Object.keys(obj).length</code> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15629799/count-number-of-keys-in-object-with-coffeescript">from</a>.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Thought process on adding a friend</h3>

<ul>
<li>page loads

<ul>
<li><p>checks to see if local storage has values</p>

<ul>
<li>if not it assigns empty array</li>
<li>if so it assigns to local array which contains a hash of both the name, the uid, and its input position

<ul>
<li>names are loaded into the input field</li>
<li>names and uid(pic) are loaded with the appropriate number of beach passes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>if when a name is removed from the input field, it is removed from the local array</p>

<ul>
<li>a listener on the array updates the proper number of beach passes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>when a name is selected by the autocomplete, it assigns pushes the new record of name, uid and position into the array</p>

<ul>
<li>a listener on the array updates the proper number of beach passes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>a validator prevents the user from continuing without having at least one friend OR checking the &#8216;alone&#8217; checkbox</p></li>
<li><p>upon hitting the continue btn, the local array is assigned to local storage</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Devise sign out</h3>

<ul>
<li>In the <code>devise.rb</code> initializer -> The default HTTP method used to sign out a resource. Default is :delete.

<ul>
<li><code>config.sign_out_via = :get</code> will allow me to use a regular link</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>PG setup</h3>

<ul>
<li>this is the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/upgrade-heroku-postgres-with-pgbackups">process prelaunch</a></li>
<li>otherwise you want to use a follower method</li>

    <updated>2013-09-11T16:35:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.adamjonas.com/blog/objective-c-for-rubyists</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So RubyMotion is great. I can create an app in a few minutes by leveraging resources like <a href="http://bubblewrap.io/">Bubblewrap</a> and styling becomes pretty straight-forward with <a href="https://github.com/rubymotion/teacup">Teacup</a> and syntax looks much more Ruby-ish with <a href="https://github.com/rubymotion/sugarcube">SugarCube</a>.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the thing. As a spoiled Rubyist, Objective-C as a language and CocoaTouch/iOS as is a framework is a verbose. That means that the code comes out really sounding like English. Not the poetry that Ruby is, but more like prose.  The fact that I am not learning the language isolated from the framework has led to problems for me in the past when I initially learned Rails before I learned Ruby. It isn&#8217;t really a great way to learn, but I have always been driven by the application of a language more than the language itself, which is the case here.</p>

<h3>That whole thing is the method?</h3>

<p>So RubyMotion isn&#8217;t a superiority thing. I&#8217;d certainly prefer to be 100% fluent in objective-c from day one. Apple&#8217;s documentation appears to be pretty steller. The problem for me however, is that everything just looks so hard in obj-c. Method declarations are pretty intimidating. So here I go to look up how to set the title of a UIButton and I find <code>- (void)setTitle:(NSString *)title forState:(UIControlState)state</code>. Now come on. That&#8217;s a little much to set a title of a button right? A guideline I have always tried to follow with my own code is to only create complicated methods for complicated tasks.</p>

<ul>
<li>This declaration is preceded by a minus (-) sign, which indicates that this is an instance method, as opposed to a class method. It requires an object to call it, and instance variables of the object are available to it inside its definition.</li>
<li>The (void) indicates the return type. This method doesn&#8217;t return anything, so its result can&#8217;t be assigned to anything.</li>
<li>This method name is <code>setTitle:forState:</code></li>
<li>The number of colons (:) indicate how many arguments it takes. T</li>
<li>The first argument is the string to set the title to.</li>
<li>The second argument is the button state (such as normal or pressed) in which to set the title.</li>
</ul>


<p>Here&#8217;s an example of this method in use: <code>[myButton setTitle:@"Clicked!" forState:UIControlStateHighlighted];</code>. So after you break it down things seems little more reasonable, but it feels like it shouldn&#8217;t be this hard.</p>

<h3></h3>

<p>The specification of a class in Objective-C requires two distinct pieces: the interface and the implementation. The interface portion contains the class declaration and defines the instance variables and methods associated with the class. The interface is usually in a .h file. The implementation portion contains the actual code for the methods of the class. The implementation is usually in a .m file.</p>

<p>A class in Objective-C can declare two types of methods: instance methods and class methods. An instance method is a method whose execution is scoped to a particular instance of the class. In other words, before you call an instance method, you must first create an instance of the class. Class methods, by comparison, do not require you to create an instance</p>

<p>There&#8217;s strong and weak typing for variables.</p>

<p>Objective-c is from around 1983, invented by Brad Cox. Ruby is from 1995, which makes it a contemporary of Java.</p>

<p>Ruby is more script oriented, obj-c looks a lot more like lisp. The semi-colon takes some getting used to.</p>

<p>Underscore versus camelCase. Short method names in Ruby, while the cocoa convention is much more verbose.</p>

<p>Name spacing in Ruby which Objective-C doesn&#8217;t have.</p>

<p>On the surface, these look like very different languages.</p>

<p>Ruby is a decedent of Smalltalk, Perl, Eiffel, and Lisp. While Objective-C comes purely from Smalltalk and C.</p>

<p>Smalltalk was really the first object oriented programming language. Alan Kay and the X PARC geniuses invented the OOP concept in the early 70s.</p>

<p>Conway&#8217;s Law: software architecture reflects the communication structures of the community that is building it.</p>

<p>Objective-c and cocoa are dictated by Apple. It&#8217;s Apple&#8217;s app store and they dictate what is appropriate and what isn&#8217;t. It is a benevolent (sometimes not so benevolent) dictatorship.</p>

<p>Ruby is on the other hand is a product of Rails. DHH singlehandedly put Ruby on the map in 2004. Rails is what the web needed in 2005. Github, heroku and twitter were all started as Rails apps.
  - most Rails devs were noobs
  - iconoclasts
  - dillitants
  - hipsters
  - scavengers -> turning to other languages
  - establishmentarians</p>

<li>Tooling -> throw out older tools</li>
<li>progress versus subsistence</li>

<p>We have entered the era of CocoaPods, which is now 2 years old. It is written in Ruby. 1300 projects on CocoaPods. This is the rise of Ruby gem. A dependency manager. This is a place to share creations.</p>

<h3>Strong versus weak pointers</h3>

<p>The difference is that an object will be deallocated as soon as there are no strong pointers to it. Even if weak pointers point to it, once the last strong pointer is gone, the object will be deallocated, and all remaining weak pointers will be zeroed out.</p>

<p>Perhaps an example is in order.</p>

<p>Imagine our object is a dog, and that the dog wants to run away (be deallocated).</p>

<p>Strong pointers are like a leash on the dog. As long as you have the leash attached to the dog, the dog will not run away. If five people attach their leash to one dog, (five strong pointers to one object), then the dog will not run away until all five leashes are detached.</p>

<p>Weak pointers, on the other hand, are like little kids pointing at the dog and saying &#8220;Look! A dog!&#8221; As long as the dog is still on the leash, the little kids can still see the dog, and they&#8217;ll still point to it. As soon as all the leashes are detached, though, the dog runs away no matter how many little kids are pointing to it.</p>

<p>As soon as the last strong pointer (leash) no longer points to an object, the object will be deallocated, and all weak pointers will be zeroed out.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/Introduction/Introduction.html">human interface guide</a></li>
<li>motion config vars</li>
</ul>


<h3>Reachability</h3>

<ul>
<li>I had all sorts of problems with the <code>reachability</code> pod on the device, while I saw no such problems on the simulator. Pretty frustrating.</li>
<li>The reachability methods seemed to be returning true even if there was no connection and it also seemed to screw up my simple requests to an external API.</li>
<li>Still not quite sure what was wrong, but as soon as I stripped out reachability the behavior returned to normal.

<ul>
<li>reachability resources I consulted were <a href="http://sxross-blog.herokuapp.com/2013/02/25/reachability-and-ruby-motion/">here</a> <a href="http://joshsymonds.com/blog/2013/02/04/reachability-with-rubymotion/">and here</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>positioning</h2>

<ul>
<li>UI elements in iOS have a frame. Think of it as the frame for a photograph on your wall. When you create elements, you have to specify the frame, in the following format:

<ul>
<li>[[x, y], [width, height]]</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>CocoaPods</h2>

<ul>
<li>like RubyGems for ruby</li>
<li>nice summary <a href="http://mobile.tutsplus.com/tutorials/iphone/streamlining-cocoa-development-with-cocoapods/">here</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>add_periodic_timer</h2>

<ul>
<li>run this code every second -> <code>EM.add_periodic_timer 1.0 do</code></li>
<li><code>add_periodic_timer</code> is actaully an <a href="http://eventmachine.rubyforge.org/EventMachine.html">event machine</a> method</li>
<li>this is made possible by the bubblewrap which used BW::Reactor

<ul>
<li>BW::Reactor is a simplified, mostly complete implementation of the Event Machine API. In fact BW::Reactor is aliased to EM in the runtime environment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Leading zeros</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5810468/leading-zeros-in-rails"><code>rjust(integer, padstr=' ') → new_str</code></a></li>
</ul>


<h3>Promotion slide menu</h3>

<ul>
<li>we started by using <a href="https://github.com/macfanatic/promotion_slide_menu">this</a> but dropped it and dropped promotion altogether.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Colors with bubble wrap</h3>

<ul>
<li>instead of <code>UIColor.whiteColor</code> you can just do <code>'white'.to_color</code></li>
</ul>

<h3>Scrolling</h3>

<ul>
<li>adding elements to a scroll is rather easy with promotion. Keep in mind that you can&#8217;t be adding multiple elements as a splat or anything. If you are iterating over a bunch of tiles, for example, they need to be added to the UIScrollView individually.</li>

<h3>Stuff I didn&#8217;t understand</h3>

<ul>
<li><code>makeKeyAndVisible</code> specifies which window is current. Despite the fact that most apps only have one window, there is no way to assume that your primary window is to be the key window. Therefore you must explicitly call makeKeyAndVisible. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14714688/examples-where-makekeyandvisible-is-not-required-for-uiwindow">see</a></li>
<li>Use a UIScrollView with pagingEnabled=YES to switch between pages, but you need pagingEnabled=NO to scroll vertically. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/728014/uiscrollview-paging-horizontally-scrolling-vertically">see</a></li>
<li>The purpose of dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier is to use less memory. If the screen can fit 4 or 5 table cells, then with reuse you only need to have 4 or 5 table cells allocated in memory even if the table has 1000 entries.<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2928873/iphone-dequeuereusablecellwithidentifier-usage">see</a></li>
<li>can&#8217;t add a target to a UIView. Need to add a UIButton to the UIView and THEN add a target to the UIButton.</li>
<li>bringSubviewToFront</li>
<li>clipsToBounds -> like overflow hidden. great for circular mask type images.</li>
<li>toll-free bridge => ruby class inheriting from objective-c ancestors so that both ruby and objective-c methods can be called on an object.</li>
</ul>


<h3>CALayers</h3>

<ul>
<li>CALayers are simply classes representing a rectangle on the screen with visual content. A <a href="http://www.raywenderlich.com/2502/calayers-tutorial-for-ios-introduction-to-calayers-tutorial">tutorial</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>RMQ => JQuery for RubyMotion</h3>

<ul>
<li>jQuery-like <a href="https://github.com/infinitered/rmq">library for RubyMotion</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ir_public.s3.amazonaws.com/projects/rmq/rmq_guide.pdf">pdf reference of methods</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>Garbage Collection</h3>

<ul>
<li>RubyMotion’s memory management system is designed to simplify the development process. Unlike traditional Objective-C programming, object references are automatically created and destroyed by the system. It is very similar to Objective-C’s ARC, in design, but it is differently implemented. <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rubymotion/hXvb9PVX0_Y">via</a>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6385212/how-does-the-new-automatic-reference-counting-mechanism-work">An explanation of ARC</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Observer Pattern vs. NSNotificationCenter vs. Key/Value Observing (KVO)</h3>

<ul>
<li>micheal erasmus has a gem <a href="https://github.com/michael-erasmus/rubymotion-observer">observable</a>, which is a compatible implementation of the ruby stdlib Observable library.</li>
<li>bubblewrap provides helper methods to give NSNotificationCenter a Ruby-like interface.</li>
<li>bubblewrap also allows you to observe for object&#8217;s changes and trigger blocks.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Deploy to device</h3>

<ul>
<li>This was a <a href="http://joshsymonds.com/blog/2012/05/10/from-the-rubymotion-simulator-to-your-friends-iphone/">tremendous help</a>. I did all the steps up to step 6.</li>
<li>we also created dot files which stored the dev cert and the path of the mobile provision</li>
</ul>


<h3>Obj-c to rubymotion</h3>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><code>UIWindow</code> is the type of the variable pointer. <code>*window</code> is the pointer. <code>UIWindow alloc</code> allocates memory and returns a new object. <code>initWithFrame</code> is calling on the new object that is created via the <code>UIWindow alloc</code>.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ul>
<li>This is a two parameter method. This first parameter is the target, which is self. Second param, is the action or method that we want to send to that target.</li>
<li>to call methods dynamically in objective-c you use the @selector(method_name). This is how it is invoked in objective-c</li>

<h3>Push Notifications</h3>

<ul>
<li>Your service (a.k.a. the publisher of the app) sends a message with a token that is wants to send a push notifcation to Apple Push Notification Service (APNS).</li>
<li>APNS then decides whether to relay your push notification onto the app.</li>
<li>there a good tutorial at <a href="https://parse.com/tutorials/ios-push-notifications">parse</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>Testing</h3>

<ul>
<li>RubyMotion uses MacBacon and the UIAnimation framework to do UI testing.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.rubymotion.com/post/26489000626/functional-view-and-controller-testing-with-rubymotion">quick tutorial</a></li>
<li>subviews are not found the same way as top level views</li>
</ul>


<h3>Location</h3>

<ul>
<li>bubblewrap provides the call <code>BW::Location.get_once { |location|}</code> which get the location just once and returns a CLLManager object. Bubblewrap offers a number of methods that can be called on the this object such as latitude and longitude.

<ul>
<li>a list of bubblewrap location methods <a href="https://github.com/rubymotion/BubbleWrap/blob/master/motion/location/location.rb">can be found here</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>NSData</h3>

<ul>
<li> Getting back NSConcreteData from an API call.

<ul>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1113811/what-is-nsconcretedata-and-where-is-it-defined">advice on stackoverflow</a> is to: ignore the existence of NSConcreteData and treat it like NSData</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Basic web service</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>users will be able to receive random motivational messages from other users</p></li>
<li><p>set up sinatra to post .json from DB</p></li>
<li><p>BW::HTTP get (URL) data</p></li>
<li><p>BW::HTTP post (URL) data</p></li>
<li><p>sinatra receives message and writes to DB</p></li>
<li><p><code>BW::HTTP</code> also has methods to make sure the response comes back ok. Not surprisingly, this is <code>response.ok?</code>. Just make sure to use this to quasi-rescue a method that depends on a request.</p></li>

<h3>Modules</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>models may have lots of behavior that isn&#8217;t related, so it probably doesn&#8217;t belong in the model layer -> usually a result of pushing behavior from the controller to the model</p>

<ul>
<li>create a concerns folder that lives in the models folder

<ul>
<li>possibly namespace the module in a class folder if only used for a specific model</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>change the autoload config path to include the concerns folder</li>
<li>include module in the model</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>in rails 4, the concerns folder will be created by default</li>
<li>&#8220;This approach to breaking up domain logic into concerns is similar in some ways to the DCI notion of Roles&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Service Objects</h3>

<ul>
<li>we are in the habit of pushing behavior from the controller to the model, but often the behavior in the controller is nicely isolated. Sometimes we need a new kind of object commonly referred to as a <em>service object</em>.</li>
<li>the service object gets it&#8217;s own folder in the app folder and <a href="https://github.com/railscasts/398-service-objects/blob/master/auth-services/app/services/authentication.rb">looks like this</a></li>
<li>this puts all the action related behavior in one place and keeps the model focused on validations, accessibility, etc.</li>
<li><p>likely works best when we have a complex controller action that interacts with a complex model</p></li>
<li><p><strong>testing</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>create a services level dir and and easily test the class directly similarly to how one would test the models</li>

    <updated>2013-05-06T12:07:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.adamjonas.com/blog/ugc-aka-david</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It is common to create apps that heavily depend on user generated content. David is an attempt to build the prototypical user generated content app. One that we will be able to reuse in the future.</p>

<p>The structure on creating such an app was challenging for me to conceptualize. I would anticipate that we will use David most of the time for image submissions only, but juggling multiple MIME type submission is the real challenge and therefore would be the greatest benefit to solve. Given this, how should this application be structured? Should the individual types (images, videos, text, audio, etc) inherit from a centralized submission class? Should that centralized class be a module that is included in each of the individual classes? Where would one build out the features for a custom app?</p>

<p>After discussing with Kyle for a while, he decided that it was probably safest to build an add-on to CarrierWave that would accomplish this for us. This would leave the uploaders available for customization, while keeping the classes more pristine.</p>

<p>There are a whole mess of add-ons <a href="https://github.com/jnicklas/carrierwave/wiki">listed</a>.</p>

<p>Next, deciding on where this add-on would live. Should this be a gem or live in the lib folder?</p>

<h3>Mixed context processor uploading</h3>

<h3>Adding Versions</h3>

</ul>


<h3>FB SDK</h3>

<ul>
<li>so I jumped right into trying to call SDK methods without understanding how the SDK was initialized.

<ul>
<li><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/javascript/#loading">the documentation</a> is pretty clear, but I had just been able to call on the SDK in previous projects, so I didn&#8217;t understand what was different. Carrot-facebook had taken care of this under the hood.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Javascript Event Listeners</h3>

<ul>
<li>excellent explanation of the difference between</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getElementById</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;db-chooser&quot;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">addEventListener</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;DbxChooserSuccess&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">someFunction</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="nx">code</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">},</span> <span class="kc">false</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>and</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getElementById</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;db-chooser&quot;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">addEventListener</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;DbxChooserSuccess&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">someFunction</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kc">false</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>which is REALLY different from:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I don&#8217;t have a firm handle on event listeners, but this is a good lesson to get my feet wet.</p>

<h3>Asset Path</h3>

<ul>
<li>stupid problem. I loaded a library to the vendor folder, but it wasn&#8217;t loading. I tried specifying the route even though I know that the asset pipeline picks up everything in the vendor folder.

<ul>
<li>ended up being the .min extension. Once I explicitly specified the extension (.min.js), it found it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Instagram</h3>

<ul>
<li>there is a <a href="https://github.com/Instagram/instagram-ruby-gem">instagram ruby gem</a> that looks very similar the <a href="https://github.com/pengwynn/">Pengwynn</a> style ruby wrappers</li>
<li>for David, I&#8217;ll be using <a href="http://mikefowler.me/instajam/">instajam</a> by Mike Fowler so that I can load the photo via javascript</li>
</ul>


<h3>Factory Girl</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/9713995255/factorygirl-2-1-0-brings-the-heat">factory girl hooks</a></li>
<li><a href="http://icelab.com.au/articles/factorygirl-and-has-many-associations/">factory girl associations</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>Rating system</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/364-active-record-reputation-system">active record reputation system</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>Responds with</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6118639/rails-respond-with-how-does-it-work">solid responds with explanation</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>Pagination</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/amatsuda/kaminari">kaminari</a> -> uses several partials to render the different options, need to override partials to customize the behavior. Because of this technique, Kaminari might be a wee bit slower than will_paginate. ActiveAdmin uses Kaminari.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mislav/will_paginate">will_paginate</a> -> uses Ruby options to customize.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Integration Tests</h3>

<ul>
<li>with rspec

<ul>
<li>install rspec

<ul>
<li><code>rails g integration_test modelname</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Copy to clipboard</h3>

<ul>
<li>it appears that the most dependable implementation is with flash. See <a href="http://www.jquery4u.com/plugins/jquery-copy-clipboard-4-options/">4 different ways</a> and ZeroClipboard(https://github.com/jonrohan/ZeroClipboard/blob/master/docs/instructions.md) which I eventually settled on. There is a nice step-by-step tutorial by <a href="http://davidwalsh.name/clipboard">David Walsh</a>.</li>
<li>put the flash file in the public folder rather than the asset path since it will remain untouched rather than serve dynamic content.</li>
</ul>


<h3>completed</h3>

<ul>
<li>one central controller with meta programmed methods to redirect to the proper path using service</li>
<li>models that inherit from a specific media type</li>
<li>override file column on submissions model -> just made it optional for text, can I make that only the case for text?</li>
<li>do for images and video what I did for text</li>
<li><p>create a whitelist of acceptable uploads per type / identify the type by the extension?</p></li>
<li><p>Facebook</p>

<ul>
<li>create credentials table with type, uid, access token, and user_id from Omniauth</li>
<li>pull photos with javascript like in oakley</li>
<li>authenticate with button and pull up a gallery of FB photos

<ul>
<li>select which one you want and store the URL</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>instagram gallery of photos</li>
</ul>


<p>  -testing
  - once photos selected, they need to be saved to DB under UrlSubmission
  - reassigning the token for FB auth</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>understand how version works</p></li>
<li><p>testing js with jasmine</p></li>
<li><p>gallery (what&#8217;s been submitted and saved to DB)</p>

<ul>
<li>highest rated (rating system)</li>
<li>/most recent (reverse time)</li>
<li>/pagination</li>
<li><p>see friend&#8217;s photos (hold off)</p></li>
<li><p>copy url from submission show page functionality</p>

<ul>
<li>https://github.com/jonrohan/ZeroClipboard</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>rating system</p>

<ul>
<li>limit frequency</li>
<li>time gate</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>winner selection lib (maybe in the end, randomly, highest rated?)</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Deficiencies</h3>

<ul>
<li>no photo resizing thus far</li>
<li>lacks integration/JS/Ajax. limited unit tests.</li>
<li>distinguish types by white labeling extensions per type, just one white labeling group right now for all types</li>
</ul>

<li>used <a href="https://github.com/fog/fog">fog</a> to store the carrierwave uploaded images on AWS</li>
<li>needed to config heroku with the <code>heroku config:add ENV_VARIABLE=bucket-name -r staging</code> to make it work</li>
<li>in carrierwave.rb need to specify the <code>config.fog_host</code>, but this is NOT the right method. It is supposed to be <code>config.asset_host</code>

<h3>xip.io</h3>

<ul>
<li>Construct your xip.io domain by appending your application&#8217;s name to your LAN IP address followed by .xip.io. For example, if your development computer&#8217;s LAN IP address is 10.0.1.43, you can visit myapp.dev from another computer on your local network using the URL http://myapp.10.0.1.43.xip.io/. <a href="http://pow.cx/manual.html#section_2.1.5">via</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>Sweepers and caching actions</h3>

<ul>
<li><code>caches_action :index</code> is all that is needed to cache an action <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/Caching/Actions.html">via</a></li>
<li><code>cache_sweeper :event_sweeper</code> is added to the Events controller to trigger the sweeper&#8230;</li>
<li>Cache sweeping is a mechanism which allows you to get around having a ton of expire_{page,action,fragment} calls in your code. It does this by moving all the work required to expire cached content into an ActionController::Caching::Sweeper subclass. This class is an observer and looks for changes to an object via callbacks, and when a change occurs it expires the caches associated with that object in an around or after filter.</li>
<li><a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/caching_with_rails.html#sweepers">Rails Guide</a></li>
<li><p>also need to turn on <code>config.cache_store = :dalli_store, ENV['MEMCACHE_SERVERS']</code></p></li>
<li><p>In the context of ActiveAdmin</p>

<ul>
<li>We weren&#8217;t expiring the events index page, but were rather expiring the ActiveAdmin page instead. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11600087/how-do-i-expire-home-page-cache-when-an-article-is-updated">This solved the problem</a>, but more specifically specifying the controller.

    <updated>2013-03-12T13:34:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.adamjonas.com/blog/another-new-macbook-air-load</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>RBENV</h3>

<ul>
<li>ran into a pow issue not recognizing my gemset -> similar <a href="https://github.com/37signals/pow/issues/202">issue to the one here</a> and <a href="http://thelucid.com/2012/10/11/pow-meet-rbenv/">here</a>.

<ul>
<li>it ended up because I had installed rbenv with homebrew which meant it was in the opts directory. What a pain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the rbenv install went pretty smoothly save for that. Used [this as a guide](http://www.bounga.org/ruby/2012/02/06/pow-using-rbenv/.</li>
</ul>


<h3>PSQL</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>the install went much smoother this time. I used this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12028037/postgres-app-could-not-start-on-port-5432/13847738#13847738">ref</a> when I ran into problems.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6867401/postgres-postgresql-fatal-database-ew-dev-does-not-exist">this helped</a> on my old air&#8230; the app installed without a hitch, but I was missing the creating of the databases.</p></li>
<li><p>when the psql app wasn&#8217;t active</p>

<p>♕ psql
psql: could not connect to server: No such file or directory
  Is the server running locally and accepting
  connections on Unix domain socket &#8220;/var/pgsql_socket/.s.PGSQL.5432&#8221;?</p></li>
<li><p>after turning it on, I got this</p>

<p>♕ psql
psql: FATAL:  database &#8220;Ajonas&#8221; does not exist</p></li>
<li><p>the PATH clearly isn&#8217;t right, but by adding <code>rake db:create:all</code> I got the app to bootup.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Bundler and Octopress reinstall</h3>

<ul>
<li>bundler wasn&#8217;t recognized because of the different ruby version. Installed the new version and <code>gem install bundler</code> as [advised](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7483515/rake-aborted-no-such-file-to-load-bundler-setup-rails-3-1.</li>
