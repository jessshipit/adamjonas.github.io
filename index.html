  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve thought deeply about how my technical inexperience impacts my abilities to manage a technical team. I think it&#8217;s a valid concern. I wrote about my thoughts on <a href="http://adamjonas.com/blog/my-take-on-maker-versus-manager/">maker vs manager</a> already, but this is a different beast. I haven&#8217;t been managing technical teams all that long and yet I have a deep rooted belief that I can be effective as an engineering manager in spite of my background.</p>

<p>I have been building teams and managing people for the bulk of my professional career. In the latter half of my twenties I ran a baseball academy in Dominican Republic. We had 30+ teenage athletes, 15 staff, two fields, dormitories, and kitchen. It was a big operation for a kid who spoken broken Spanish and never played the sport professionally. To compensate, I was a tyrant. I made all the calls and I shouldered the whole load. I constantly felt no one was doing enough. I felt like I was the only one who made sure the kids got what they needed. The staff hated me. I didn&#8217;t care. I controlled the daily schedule and the food deliveries. I checked that the grass was cut and the players weren&#8217;t sneaking out past curfew. I was scrappy and I was a hard-ass. In retrospect, I&#8217;m sorry my staff had to pay the the price for my education.  Those years burned me out. I was lonely. I was stressed. I was a single point of failure. I was a terrible version of myself and I knew I&#8217;d never do it that way again.</p>

<p>Part of my growth as a person has been to get past my own insecurities. I learned to be comfortable not knowing the answer. Once I started managing a tech team, it took me a while to understand that really good devs often <strong>don&#8217;t</strong> want any people management responsibilties and so I strive to be their sh!t umbrella. I work to isolate them from the politics and meetings so that they can focus on what they do best &#8211; make magic. I would no doubt be more valuable if I had more reps, but my focus has been to strive to understand how the systems fit together and ask the right questions rather than lord over the implementation.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t fake my background. I learned to code late. It is a constraint I can&#8217;t change. While I can work to refine my instincts and up my skills, I&#8217;m at peace with the fact I will never be the CTO. At least not the traditional kind. As I age and better understand myself, I&#8217;ve learned I am more effective when learning from my reports rather than handing down instructions. Even though it doesn&#8217;t feel like it on the subway, <a href="http://www.medicaldaily.com/human-brain-hardwired-acts-kindness-vagus-nerve-activated-during-empathy-313020">humans are hardwired for kindness</a>. People energize me and I find satisfaction in helping a group discover cohesion. There will always be more to learn. The tech changes and so do the people. Businesses evolve demanding different kinds of leaders. But when we put people first, I&#8217;ve found the other pieces fall into place because trust and rapport create forgiveness and understanding. Or at least that&#8217;s what my experience has taught me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>React event</h2>

<ul>
<li>similar to normal <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/handling-events.html">event handling</a> (responds to target and such, but has other properties)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Refs and the Dom</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html">ref documentation</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>Props</h2>

<ul>
<li>They are the mechanism used in React for passing data from parent to child components</li>
<li>Props can’t be changed from inside the component; they are passed and “owned” by the parent.</li>
</ul>


<h2>State</h2>

<ul>
<li>React’s components can have mutable data inside this.state.</li>
<li>when the state is updated, the component triggers the reactive rendering, and the component itself and its children will be re-rendered. As mentioned, this happens very quickly due to React’s use of a virtual DOM.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Component to action to store</h2>

<ul>
<li> the store is subscribed to the action</li>
<li> components subscribed to stores -> re-render</li>
<li><p> props are immutible -> given the state of the application, what doe the component look like?</p></li>
<li><p>?what is the value of the actions step -> ususually just passing through to the store</p></li>
<li><p>user inputs triggers the action</p></li>
<li>inputs into the system -> actions</li>
<li>action updates the state</li>
<li><p>which updates the components</p></li>
<li><p>store is more flexibile than backbone collections and models</p></li>
<li>based on the change what literal DOM manipulations are needed -> taken care of virtual DOM</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Posix shell and Utilities</h2>

<ul>
<li>from <a href="http://shellhaters.org/talk">Shell Hater&#8217;s handbook with Ryan Tomayko</a></li>
<li><a href="http://shellhaters.org/">posix docs</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>fork() &amp; exec()</h2>

<ul>
<li>When running exec() programs, you are forking a shell and running it on that</li>
<li><a href="https://www.bottomupcs.com/fork_and_exec.xhtml">Fork and exec</a></li>
<li><a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/428458/why-do-shells-call-fork">Why do shells call fork?</a>

<ul>
<li>exec can only run one thing. So shell creates the child shell runs exec and then returns.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>fork() clones the current process, creating an identical child. exec() loads a new program into the current process, replacing the existing one. <a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/179604/how-do-fork-and-exec-work">From</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>Time slice</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preemption_(computing">time slice</a>#Time_slice) managed by the scheduler of the CPU. Time slices are <a href="https://superuser.com/a/684394">variable</a> -> need this to keep the illusion of concurrency(having multiple processes at the same time) and multi-tasking, but with one core there is no possibility of doing paralellism.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Builtins</h2>

<ul>
<li>(wikipedia)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_builtin]

<ul>
<li>executed directly in the shell itself, instead of an external executable program which the shell would load and execute.</li>
<li>Shell builtins work significantly faster than external programs, because there is no program loading overhead.</li>
<li>most notable example is <code>cd</code></li>
<li><code>cd</code> has to be a builtin because the shell itself needs to change its &#8220;cwd&#8221; - current working directory - not a sub-process. The goal of &#8220;cd&#8221; is to change the current working directory of the shell itself, and that can&#8217;t be accomplished from a child process without a lot of special hackery which would end up being more complex than the builtin. <a href="https://www.quora.com/Unix-Why-is-cd-a-built-in-command-in-the-shell-and-not-an-executable-program-like-the-command-ls">from</a>

<ul>
<li>great explanation on how it came to be with a quote from <a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/38819">Dennis Ritchie</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Memory Management</h2>

<ul>
<li>swap -> using the hard disk as RAM</li>
<li>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_table">page table</a> is the data structure used by a virtual memory system in a computer operating system to store the mapping between virtual addresses and physical addresses. Virtual addresses are used by the accessing process, while physical addresses are used by the hardware, or more specifically, by the RAM subsystem.</li>

paralellization (a module for apache)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>deployer for Ironboard -> easy way to manage keys</li>
<li>how owns the process, who owns the directory where the config
files lives</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>etc/passwd</code> -> all the users on the box and who is logged in</li>
<li>every service that has a port open to the internet it should have
its own user</li>
<li>username is usually the service name</li>
<li><code>/var</code> is usually the log directory</li>
<li><code>/etc</code> is usually the config directory</li>
<li>WAL-E

<ul>
<li>ship our binary logs we sent to s3</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write-ahead_logging">write ahead logs</a> -> must be complete before actually modifies the
DB with a transaction. This is the mechanism for rollbacks.

<ul>
<li>master just sends the write-ahead logs to the slave which then
just replays them</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Backups

<ul>
<li>take a base and then the have these WAL backups and send them off
and it will apply all the deltas</li>
<li>can give us point in time restoration</li>
<li>these logs will fill up our disk</li>
<li>? how long do we keep WAL-E</li>
<li>interface for deleting backups, s3 logs</li>
<li>config of pg is <code>pg_hba.conf</code></li>
<li>script to switch over primary/replication script turns <code>recovery.conf</code> to <code>recovery.done</code></li>
<li><code>failover.sh</code> on the other replica as root

<ul>
<li>breaks replication, now need to configure replication on the new
replication server</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iptables">iptables</a> -> firewall</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Permissions</h2>

<ul>
<li>User, Group, World -> multiple users on the same machine, make sure
processes don&#8217;t do stuff they aren&#8217;t supposed to</li>
<li>chmod 755, 644</li>
<li>all directories have to be 7

<ul>
<li>directories point to other files</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>cd is a program that takes a directory (file) as an argument and
executes it</li>
<li><code>etc/sudoers</code> -> determines who has root permissions; visudo -> creates a backup and prevents brackage</li>
<li><code>useradd</code> give them a shell and name the user; want to add to the
chef script</li>
</ul>


<h2>load balancer</h2>

<ul>
<li>front-end is learn.co, terminating SSL, in the</li>
<li>backend -></li>
<li>should be root on</li>
</ul>


<h2>Debugging</h2>

<ul>
<li><code>passenger-status --show=requests</code></li>
<li><code>passenger-status</code></li>
</ul>


<h2>Automatic provisioning</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/digitalocean/doctl">doctl</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/petems/tugboat">tugboat</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>cron</h2>

<ul>
<li>sends mail</li>
</ul>


<h2>IDE backend</h2>

<ul>
<li>backend application -> IDE umbrella</li>
<li>main one is learn-ide-server cookbook</li>
<li>different chef servers</li>
<li>wombat</li>
<li>traffic cop</li>
<li>elixir-build01 -> build elixir on server because linux</li>
<li>new server needs to be added to <a href="https://github.com/flatiron-labs/students-chef-repo/tree/master/cookbooks/learn-ide-haproxy">HAproxy</a></li>
<li>lb -> <code>balance url_param token</code> hashing algorithm that determines
which server the IDE connects to based on their Learn oauth token. (Optimization -> make hashing algo
more granualar so that if a machine gets taken out the rotation, the
othere aren&#8217;t rebalanced as well</li>
<li>Load balance assignment is determined by dynect traffic management

<ul>
<li>own health monitoring</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gluster.org/">gluster</a> is fancy NFS

<ul>
<li>RAID -> redundant array of independent disks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://coreos.com/rkt/">rkt</a></li>
<li>PTY - psuedoterminal, terminal emulator, connect to an arbitrary shell</li>
<li>inotify -> FS event watcher</li>
<li>containerization

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufs">aufs</a> loser -> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UnionFS">unionfs</a> winner that was merged into linux</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>? do you bump archived tar&#8217;ed files when you archive again</li>
</ul>


<h2>IDE Umbrella</h2>

<ul>
<li>for adding IDE server (<a href="https://github.com/flatiron-labs/ide_umbrella/blob/master/config/prod.exs">node list</a>)</li>
<li>dependencies in <code>mix.exs</code>; <a href="https://github.com/ninenines/cowboy">cowboy</a> is the webserver, <a href="https://github.com/devinus/poolboy">poolboy</a></li>
<li>applications are like slightly fancy supervisors, <a href="https://github.com/bitwalker/distillery">distillery</a> release packaging</li>
<li><code>mix deps.get</code> -> get dependencies</li>
<li><code>iex -S mix</code></li>
<li><code>:cowboy.start</code> -> erlang library, cowboy is lib which is an atom</li>
<li><code>gen_server</code>, an abstraction on top of processes in general

<ul>
<li>provides state and a little behavior</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>agent</code> is just for state</li>
<li>every connection gets its own process</li>
<li>distillery builds them

<ul>
<li>release -> full replacement of previous release, must restart</li>
<li>upgrade -> release plus upgrade instructions, relup file, modify
the code in memory -> hotswap; preferable to release</li>
<li><code>mix edeliver version qa</code></li>
<li><code>mix edeliver version production</code></li>
<li><code>mix edeliver build release</code></li>
<li><code>mix edeliver deployer release to qa</code></li>
<li><code>mix edeliver restart qa</code></li>
<li><code>bin/ide start</code></li>
<li><code>bin/ide attach</code> -> quit with ^D, not ^c (will kill process)</li>
<li><code>bin/ide remote_console</code></li>
<li><code>mix edeliver build upgrade --with=0.1.0+232424323-hdhfd</code></li>
<li><code>mix edeliver deploy upgrade to qa</code> -> will prompt for version
number</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Chef</h2>

<ul>
<li>server provisioning

<ul>
<li>consistency, automation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>inheritance in the cookbooks, base cookbook -> security</li>
<li>like ruby base cookbooks</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.chef.io/2013/12/03/doing-wrapper-cookbooks-right/">wrapper cookbook</a>, like forking a cookbook without modifying it

<ul>
<li>increasing levels of abstraction</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>conventions of chef aren&#8217;t very clearly defined</li>
<li>differences between recipes and cookbooks?</li>
</ul>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Intro</h2>

<p>&#8220;elastic search is full text sreach engine, non-relational DB, analytics engine&#8221;</p>

<ul>
<li>has clustering and managed over REST</li>
<li><p>Suggest Explicit mapping</p></li>
<li><p>keywords -> non-analyzed data</p></li>
<li><p>full text -> analyzed</p></li>
<li><p>filters -> will need <code>bool</code> then <code>filters</code></p></li>
</ul>


<h2>relevance -> score meta data field for document match</h2>

<ul>
<li>things are ranked</li>
<li>filters are faster and don&#8217;t have relevance (so if you don&#8217;t care, go with fiters)</li>
<li>can boost relevance</li>
</ul>


<h2>multi-index multi-type</h2>

<ul>
<li>lots of power</li>
</ul>


<h2>Aggregation -> group by on steroids</h2>

<ul>
<li>SQL: group by the bucket</li>
<li>aggregator -> can do nested group by and data retrieval</li>
</ul>


<h2>Managing elastic search</h2>

<ul>
<li>clustering

<ul>
<li>odd number of nodes bigger than 1

<ul>
<li>3 shards and replication</li>
<li>a third node can shuffle the shards and the replicas</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>ELK Stack</h2>

<ul>
<li>elastic search, logstash, and kubana</li>
<li>logstash

<ul>
<li>want to parse and stash log data</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>kubana

<ul>
<li>front end visualizer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>now beats added -> lightweight, written in go -> for shipping</li>
</ul>


<h2>Split Brain issue</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://blog.trifork.com/2013/10/24/how-to-avoid-the-split-brain-problem-in-elasticsearch/">HOW TO AVOID THE SPLIT-BRAIN PROBLEM IN ELASTICSEARCH</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>Tinc</h2>

<ul>
<li>VPN -> encrypts traffic between servers</li>
</ul>


<h2>Setting up elastic search</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-elasticsearch-on-ubuntu-16-04">setting up a elasticsearch cluster on ubuntu</a></li>
<li>used a ruby case statement to set the master versus the replicas up</li>
<li><a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/_basic_concepts.html">shards, replicas, documents explained</a></li>
<li><a href="https://qbox.io/blog/launching-and-scaling-elasticsearch">Thoughts on Launching and Scaling Elasticsearch</a></li>
<li><a href="https://qbox.io/blog/optimizing-elasticsearch-how-many-shards-per-index">optimizing sharding</a>

<ul>
<li><code>A good launch point for capacity planning is to allocate shards with a factor of 1.5 to 3 times the number of nodes in your initial configuration. If you're starting with 3 nodes, then we recommend that you specify at most 3 x 3 = 9 shards.</code></li>
<li><code>We reiterate that shards consume resources and require processing overhead.</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>needed to bump vm.max_map_count according to <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/vm-max-map-count.html">these instructions</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-firewall-with-ufw-on-ubuntu-16-04">UFW</a> -> wasn&#8217;t needed in the end</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Why machine learning - you can predict the future</h2>

<ul>
<li>Explosion of data, more available than ever</li>
<li>sheer processing power available at a reasonable price point</li>
</ul>


<h2>Data Preparation Tools</h2>

<ul>
<li>Rstudio -> data prep and execute the machine learning</li>
<li>jupyter notebooks -> python in the cloud</li>
<li>excel -> stick with the tools you know</li>
<li>azure machine learning studio</li>
<li>scikit learn (competitor to r studio) for python</li>
<li>relational database tools (SQL queries)</li>
<li>sed / awk</li>
<li>python, r, sql most common languages to clean up data</li>
</ul>


<h2>Data Cleaning</h2>

<ul>
<li>missing values in data or repeating values in data (blanks, null,
n/a, unknown, 999999)</li>
<li>what&#8217;s your business goal?

<ul>
<li>SPCA - can you help us predict what animals won&#8217;t get adopted?</li>
<li>got enough data to be significant, you can delete rows -> not
always an option</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>can substitute a specific value (can go with a worst case
scenario)</li>
<li>fill forward and fill backwards based on the last value we read ->
going to have to write code</li>
<li>R is.na()</li>
<li><p>python pandas.fillna(), pandas.isnull()</p></li>
<li><p>excel tips -></p>

<ul>
<li>select individual columns, go to special, select blanks (will
select every blank cell) and you can enter a value</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>repeated values</p>

<ul>
<li>causes a bias in the data</li>
<li>duplicate row vs duplicate IDs</li>
<li>r duplicated()</li>
<li>python dataframe.drop_duplicates</li>
<li>SQL DISTINCT or correctlated queries</li>
<li>correlated subquery -> if the rows are the same but the IDs are different when you find
two identitical records and delete the one with the lower ID
number</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Data Transformation</h2>

<ul>
<li>Decomposition

<ul>
<li>the more you know about the data, the better</li>
<li>one column represents two or more values (like addresses lumped
together and finding the city and state)</li>
<li>return a 1 or 0 to represented spayed and nuetered</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Aggregation</p>

<ul>
<li>how many copies of different books to keep in stock?</li>
<li>don&#8217;t want the day it was sold, want total number of books sold
per wk/mon x date</li>
<li>select count(*) from sales group by (books sold per period)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Scaling</p>

<ul>
<li>predict how long a patient admitted the flu will need to stay in
the hospital</li>
<li>because the age has a wider varience in age you don&#8217;t see the
lower differences like temperatute

<ul>
<li>create ranges -> normalizing, standardizing</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Training data versus test data</p>

<ul>
<li>subject matter experts become important as they need to undetr</li>
<li>tumors -> which do you want, one with more false positives and one
with more false negatives</li>
</ul>

<h2>Machines vs. Humans</h2>

<ul>
<li>machines don&#8217;t get tired or make mistake as they fatigue</li>
<li>law is boring and machines don&#8217;t get bored</li>
<li>The future of employement -> company secretaries</li>
<li>machines handle grunt work and humans handle human decisions -> the
more abstract the less likely you are to be replaced by a computer</li>
<li>the more predictable we are as programmers, the more likely we are
going to be replaced</li>
<li>AI software that makes AI software</li>
<li>past being factory workers and finding the way to add value</li>
<li>the saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers
knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom.</li>
<li>just making money isn&#8217;t enough anymore</li>
<li>Orwell predicted cameras everyone but didn&#8217;t predict we would buy the camera</li>
<li>&#8220;Technological progress has merely provided us with more efficient
means for going backwards.&#8221; -> Aldous Huxley</li>
<li>&#8220;the power of big data and psychographics&#8221;</li>
<li>inclusive design set that microsoft released</li>
<li>it&#8217;s not about allowing access but avoiding barriers</li>
<li>spotlight - show me my documents larger than 20 pages</li>
<li>netflix -> fast movement can be compressed more than slow movement</li>
<li>Aipoly -> identify objects on the phone, not running on the internet</li>
<li>facebook open sourced identifying objects</li>
<li>AI lip reading for 46% accuracy, humans have 12% accuracy</li>
<li>imagenet and open images dataset -> image data sets, properly
trained data sets to play with</li>
<li><code>captionbot.ai</code></li>
